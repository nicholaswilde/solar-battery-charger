# battery

Reads value on analog input A0 and calculates the the percent level of a lipo battery.

## Hypothesis

The Adafruit Feather Huzzah can be used to monitor the level of a lipo battery.

## Assumptions

WIP

## Procedure

### Circuit

Connect a 3.7V lipo battery to the Adafruit Feather Huzzah and create a 
voltage divider using a `1MΩ` and `220kΩ` resistor.
